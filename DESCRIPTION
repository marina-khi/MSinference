Description: This package performs a multiscale analysis of a nonparametric
  regression (or nonparametric regressions) with time series errors. In case
  of one regression, with the help of this package it is possible to detect
  the regions where the trend function is increasing or decreasing.
  In case of multiple regressions, the test identifies regions where
  the trend functions are different from each other. See
  Khismatullina and Vogt (2020), Khismatullina and Vogt (2022) and
  Khismatullina and Vogt (2023) for more details on theory and
  applications.
